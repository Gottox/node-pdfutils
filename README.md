PDF Utils for node
==================

This library contains tools for analysing and converting PDF files. You can
get metadata, extract text, render pages to svg or png, all with our beloved
asynchronous programming style.

It is planed to support extracting links from the document and create ImageMaps
([You remember them, don't you?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_map)) on
the fly. Also pdfutils should support password locked files.
But that's still on the todo.

The library is currently beta. This means it has incomplete error handling and
it lacks a testing suite.

Installation
------------

To install pdfutils you have to install libpoppler-glib first.

Using Debian execute:

	apt-get install libpoppler-glib-dev libpoppler-glib8 libcairo2-dev libcairo2

Using MacOS and Macports:

	port install poppler
	
or if you prefere brew:

	brew install poppler --with-glib
	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/X11/lib/pkgconfig

Then install pdfutils

	npm install pdfutils

Usage
-----

See this very basic example:

	var pdfutils = require('pdfutils').pdfutils;

	pdfutils("document.pdf", function(err, doc) {
		doc[0].asPNG({maxWidth: 100, maxHeight: 100}).toFile("firstpage.png");
	});

3sloc to generate thumbnails of PDFs. Awesome!

Here a bit more documentation:

### pdfutils(source, callback)

this function is a factory for Documents

arguments:

 * __source__: can be a Buffer or a String. If it's a string, read from the
  file. If it's a buffer, treat the buffer content as in-memory PDF.
  Please make sure to not change the buffer while using it by pdfutils!
 * __callback(err, doc)__: a callback with the following arguments:
   * _err_: an error string when the pdf couldn't be loaded successfully,
     otherwise `null`
   * _doc_: an instance of `Document` when the pdf is loaded successfully,
     otherwise `undefined`

### Class PDFDocument

   * _maxWidth_: maximal width of the resulting SVG in px.
   * _minWidth_: minimal width of the resulting SVG in px.
   * _maxHeight_: maximal height of the resulting SVG in px.
   * _minHeight_: minimal height of the resulting SVG in px.
   * _width_: the width of the resulting SVG in px. Overwrites minWidth and
     maxWidth.
   * _height_: the height of the resulting SVG in px. Overwrites minHeight and
